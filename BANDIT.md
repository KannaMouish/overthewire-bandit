Username: bandit4

Password: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

Commands:

ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls  shows inhere directory 
cd inhere 
ls  shows -file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
For the first time, I have cat every file and found the password, but I can also use 
find -type f | xargs file | grep text -- find is a command to find, -type f makes the search only for files but not for directories or other types of objects,  Xargs - as file command cant take inputs directly, you need xargs for taking list of filenames from pipe line and passes them as arguments for file. here file command determines the type of the file. in them to if you apply grep text, you only get file with text content. 
command - find -type f | xargs file | grep text result file07. 


Level 5 â†’ 6

Commands:

ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# commands here
characters of the file in which the password has been stored. We can achieve each by a different command as follows.
human-readable -  we can use the file command for determining the file type. If the file command's output for a given file includes terms like "ASCII text," "UTF-8 Unicode text," or indicates a specific type of script (e.g., "shell script," "Python script") and "text executable," it suggests the file is human-readable. If the output describes the file as a "binary," "executable," or other non-textual format, it is likely not directly human-readable.
1033 bytes in size -size 1033c
not executable ! -executable
command - find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable | xargs file | grep text
 result - ./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)
command - cat ./maybehere07/.file2
